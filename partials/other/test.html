		<ul>
			<li><span class="text-red">Unit testing</span>: Isolates and tests small "units" of code, without 
				taking context into consideration.</li>
			<li><span class="text-red">E2E testing</span>: Runs and tests full areas of an application, from the beginning to
				the end. Generally, they reproduce typical user operations.</li>
		</ul>
